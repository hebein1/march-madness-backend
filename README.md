This is the backend for the march madness prediction algorithm. Some things we wish to account for in the algorithm:
-W/L (decision tree with all teams)
-Strength of schedule
-Past 5 games
-Defensive Rank (take in account past defensive stats)
-Offensive Rank (ditto)
-Home/ Away
-Player injuries
-More, Hoping to make it modular
